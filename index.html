    <h1>Welcome!</h1>
    <p>here you can run, test, and debug your code, all from the comfort of your browser! (there are some caveats for each different language, in order to bypass most of them, simply spawn an arch instance from copy.sh, linked below. NOTE: you are running a full virtualized linux installation from the web, and therefore it will be slow, however it runs locally so it fits in the same vein/theme of this project. I'm working on adding our own version of this to our website so you don't have to visit another person's (essentially i'll follow his instructions and provide credit to him, of course).</p>
